First of all marginal probabilities are eyeballed.
This is simply a matter of drawing the distribution of each column.
- Determine the range from the min and the max of a column
- Divide it into say 64 bins
- Create an array of 64 floats
- Count the relative frequencies  in that array
- Visualize the array by printing a numer of MMM proportional to each frequency (so the graph is "rotated" 90 degrees)
